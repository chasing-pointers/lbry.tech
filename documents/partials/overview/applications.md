Applications are the final level of the LBRY stack. They represent how most people will actually use LBRY.

Applications typically use the [[lbry-sdk]], which provides convenient API methods for building applications.

LBRY Inc. currently releases and maintains three applications:

- [LBRY Desktop](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop), a desktop browser for the LBRY network based in React and Electron available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- [LBRY Android](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-android), an Android browser for the LBRY network in React Native and available in the playstore.
- [spee.ch](https://github.com/lbryio/spee.ch), a web-based sharing and organizational app designed for self-hosting.

A central idea of LBRY is that there's _not_ a singular way to interact with the network. Anyone can build on top of LBRY in a permissionless manner. LBRY Inc. maintains open-source applications to show what's possible and to give new users a user-friendly experience on the network.
